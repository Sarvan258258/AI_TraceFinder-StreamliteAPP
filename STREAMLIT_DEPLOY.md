# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy Steps

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (which you've already done!)
2. **Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)**
3. **Connect your GitHub account**
4. **Deploy from your repository:** `Sarvan258258/AI_TraceFinder-StreamliteAPP`

## Important Files for Deployment

### ✅ Essential Files (Already Created)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `packages.txt` - System packages for OpenCV
- `app.py` - Main application
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Model information

### 📁 Model Files (Upload Separately)
Since model files are large, they're not in the Git repository. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Demo Mode (Current)
- App runs with simulated results
- Perfect for showcasing the UI and functionality
- No model files needed

#### Option 2: Full Functionality
Upload these files to your repository in the `models/` folder:
```
models/
├── scanner_hybrid.keras
├── hybrid_label_encoder.pkl
├── hybrid_feat_scaler.pkl
├── scanner_fingerprints.pkl
├── fp_keys.npy
├── tamper_svm_model.pkl
├── tamper_svm_scaler.pkl
└── tamper_svm_threshold.pkl
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. OpenCV Issues
- ✅ Fixed: Using `opencv-python-headless` 
- ✅ Fixed: Added system packages in `packages.txt`

### 2. TensorFlow Issues
- ✅ Fixed: Using `tensorflow-cpu` for lighter deployment
- Memory optimization for cloud environment

### 3. Large File Issues
- Model files should be < 100MB each for GitHub
- Consider using Git LFS for large model files
- Or use cloud storage and download at runtime

## App Features in Demo Mode

Even without model files, the app demonstrates:
- ✅ Professional UI with all layouts
- ✅ File upload and processing
- ✅ Simulated analysis results
- ✅ Export functionality
- ✅ PDF processing
- ✅ Interactive visualizations

## Deploy URL
After deployment, your app will be available at:
`https://sarvan258258-ai-tracefinder-streamliteapp-app-[random].streamlit.app`

## Environment Variables (Optional)
You can set these in Streamlit Cloud settings:
- `DEMO_MODE=true` - Force demo mode
- `MODEL_PATH=/path/to/models` - Custom model path
